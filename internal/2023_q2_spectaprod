### Proposal - 2023 Q2 - Tim Munsell (spectaprod)

Internal budget proposal for Dash Incubator

### Background 

The [Incubator rules doc (v3)](https://github.com/dashincubator/dash-incubator-rules/blob/042fde0eea2340a2a8c9fa3483ad8f764d94fe31/rules.md) directs individual strategists to submit internal budget proposals to the Lead Strategist.

From the Rules document:

> 5.1.2 Strategist Proposals #
> Each Strategist submits quarterly proposals to the Lead Strategist to increase their budgets. The content and purpose of this proposal is similar to the Lead Strategistâ€™s Network Proposal. It should report project updates, value propositions, budget spending, quarterly priorities, and anything else the strategist wants to commmunicate in order to help justify the value delivered to the network for the funding received and requested.

### Project Updates & Budget Spending

My Q1 budget was 300 Dash, of which 652.2 was distributed in rewards across the following bounties (in decending order of rewards paid):

* [Atomic Swaps](https://trello.com/c/o9l91FLG) - This bounty is I took over in Q3 that is enabling direct swaps, currently focused on Dash <> Eth.
* **Status:** functional prototype is 95% complete
  * The bulk of Q1 activity was updating core components to be compatible with network upgrades - this is ~95% complete.
  * Q2 2023 will see a migration from sdk dependent on testnet to dashmate and a complete functional prototype.
* [Goal/Challenge Platform](https://trello.com/c/8Hy6K7fE) - This is a dapp utilizing Platform smart contract capabilities to create bet-on-yourself games or challenges. Users can create, find, join, and complete games wagering Dash on their individual success.
  * **Status:** MVP is 95% complete.
  *Q1 included updates to core components and completion of several user functions. This bounty is nearing completion of the MVP.
  * In Q2 we will complete the MVP.
* [Platform Console](https://trello.com/c/Xezls3IC) - This bounty creates a Dash Platform wallet, identity, username, contract, and document all from a web browser with no coding required
  * **Status:** ongoing - this is a lower priority project and only receive "margin time" focus.
  * Development in Q1 created a public staging environment that enables better QA/QC.
  * In Q2 progress is uncertain. There are multiple "legacy" components that are not document that the dev will need to research before updating to be compatible with the lates network version.
* [Local Money](https://trello.com/c/fjdVR5U4) - This is a dash "onramp" designed to facilitate p2p Dash <> fiat exchanges providing the ability to seek, find, and execute trades.
  * **Status:** ~30% complete
  * Q1 UI development created wireframes. There were some difficulties in communication that resulted in duplicated efforts and slowed progress. MVP workflows are completed
  * UI development will conclude in Q2 and we will begin initial code development. My goal is to release a Public alpha (to the Dash development community) in early Q3.
* [Dashmate Assistance](https://trello.com/c/11azWJXT) - *previously named Dashmate Bug Fixes, Improvements & Innovations* This is an ongoing bounty to support ongoing development, improvements, fixes, etc. for Dashmate.
  * **Status:** ongoing
  * There was continued progress Q1 to migrate the dash-network-deploy.
  * Q2 include completing dash-network-deploy and several other DCG requests. This project is primarily supporting Dashmate on behalf of DCG.
* [Interactive Dash Ecosystem Webpage](https://trello.com/c/djmlrMDC) - This is closely related to the infographic (above). It is the "presentation layer" presenting the infographic for easy display and navigation in a web browser across mulitple languages. You can see the infographic, available interactions, and hosting environment [here] (https://media.dash.org/wp-content/uploads/Dash-Ecosystem-English-4K-2022-05-11.jpg)
  * **Status:** on hold - future tasks will be dependent on infographic updates
  * In Q1 the development of the current version was complete. It now needs a permanent home.
  * In Q2 I want to get this hosted, our preference is on dash.org.
* [Private Messenger Dapp](https://trello.com/c/LUyEnwJ9) - An account free private messenger.
  * **Status:** uncertain
  * Work began again Q1 after nearly a 12 month hiatus (a new dev expressed interested). The application received a UI (was previously only command line).
  * Q2 work is tbd (all current tasks are complete and next steps need to be Spec'd)
* [Dash Core Contributions](https://trello.com/c/dbkj327J) - this is an ongoing bounty that rewards Dash for merged PRs to the [Dash Core repo](https://github.com/dashpay/dash) on Github to any non-DCG developers. This bounty is administered by Pasta
  * **Status:** ongoing
  * In Q1 a couple medium sized PRs were awarded.
  * Q2 2023 will see continued progress and development for the new functionality that was specified (in QA now)
* [Dash Incubator Updates](https://trello.com/c/wva1ykr6) - I transitioned strategy for this bounty to Rion. The rewards for Spec completion related to the transition.
  * **Status:** transitioned to Rion
* [Dashstamp](https://trello.com/c/nvmKHDR1) - This will create a document notary service built on Dash Platform.
  * **Status:** on hold
  * In late Q1 a new developer expressed interest in this bounty and re-satarted work completing the current specification tasks
  * In Q2 we will need to decide whether to pursue development or wait until Platform is released.
* [Coindurance Site](https://trello.com/c/F01Stzee) - This was a concept I accepted on behalf of Rion and transitioned to his strategic leadership.
  * **Status:** transitioned to Rion
* [Dash Incubator Getting Started](https://trello.com/c/Gc2vzB0E) - This ongoing bounty rewards various activities for introducing and onboarding new contributors.
  * **Status:** ongoing
  * In Q1 the contribution was completed QA.
  * A contributor has come forward and expressed interest in managing this bounty. I need to make decisions regarding that, or if this bounty is not worth our current efforts.
* [Read Investments Data from Blockchain](https://trello.com/c/nvmKHDR1) - This will create a public facing place users can quickly search and reference the history of proposals to MNOs. This will include light data manipulation capabilities and include csv download of project and funding daa for further local analysis.
  * **Status:** ~50% complete
  * In Q4 the progress toward complete was minimal consisting mostly of QA of and Spec work for next steps
  * Q1 2023 will see code development from UX design and the deployment of data extraction, manipulation, and visualization functionality.
  * The biggest risk/difficulty is and has been that the primary contributors are located in Ukraine

My Q1 proposal also included the following bounties on which I didn't make any progress:

* [DashSee](https://trello.com/c/UALbkO5H) - Similar to the above, the primary contributors are not active with the incubator at this time. A new contributer has begun to work, but no work was completed before the end of the quarter.
* [Dash Ecosystem Infographic](https://trello.com/c/L306RZDn) - This was an inherited bounty, and is nearing completion. This is a graphical representation of the entire Dash ecosystem for quick reference. Link to the current state is in below.
* [Decentralized Dynamic Application Infrastructure](https://trello.com/c/q16cvr5A) - This bounty is in progress again. The greatest difficulty has been that each testnet version requires new updates before development can continue. Effectively, this bounty is paused pending the stable release of Platform.

### Quarterly Priorities & Value Propositions

During the upcoming quarter I expect to fund progress across most of the bounties I funded last quarter. I expect my top priorities will continue to be:

* [Goal/Challenge Platform](https://trello.com/c/8Hy6K7fE) - This MVP has more development, depending on pace I hope we can have a release by early Q2. I see this as a easy, socially shareable, means of introducing new user to Dash and even crypto in general.
* [Local Money](https://trello.com/c/fjdVR5U4) - The UI for the MVP will be completed and I expect to make progress toward a functioning dapp.

### Budget Request

I am requesting 150 DASH/month for 3 months.  This will cover funding my current projects at my current pace and prevent further draw down of my current reserve(stands at is 324).
