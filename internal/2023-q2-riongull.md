### Proposal - 2023 Q1 - Rion Gull

Internal budget proposal for Dash Incubator

### Background

The [Incubator rules doc (v3)](https://github.com/dashincubator/dash-incubator-rules/blob/042fde0eea2340a2a8c9fa3483ad8f764d94fe31/rules.md) directs the lead strategist to submit internal budget proposals to the strategic committee.

Section 5.1.2 (Strategist Proposals):

> Each Strategist submits quarterly proposals to the Lead Strategist to increase their budgets. The content and purpose of this proposal is similar to the Lead Strategistâ€™s Network Proposal. It should report project updates, value propositions, budget spending, quarterly priorities, and anything else the strategist wants to commmunicate in order to help justify the value delivered to the network for the funding received and requested.

Section 4.5 (Governance):

> The Strategic Committee is responsible to:
> 
> * Approve or reject Incubator rule changes (updates to this document).
> * Approve or reject quarterly budget requests from the Lead Strategist.

This proposal is for Q2 of 2023.

### Project Updates & Budget Spending

Last quarter I awarded bounties to the 13 projects listed in section 2 of the [Dash Incubator 2023 Q2](https://www.dashcentral.org/p/dash-incubator-2023-q2) proposal.  Total rewards excluding the 1 DASH proposal fee were 1,776 DASH (~592 DASH/month).

The majority of funds were spent improving payment tools and the building the CrowdNode SDK, CLI, and UI.

### Quarterly Priorities & Value Propositions

In this quarter I plan to use funds for the following:

* Delegate budgets to other strategists.
* Finish the GitHub migration.
* Clean up (and possibly retire) our Trello board.
* Make a rule change to simplify them and remove Trello dependency.
* Finish existing straggling projects such as the thumbnail image project.
* Fund a professional audit of (and possible upgrade to) our Dash documentation.  I've found someone well qualified to do this, and they're interested.
* Fund a hackathon for a major web2 project.  I have confirmed with the project, but it's not public yet.

### Budget Request

I am requesting 550 DASH/month for this quarter from the Incubator general budget.

450 DASH/month from my reserve will go to cover budget requests from other strategists.  This leaves only 100 DASH/month for my own projects.  I have a sizable reserve to draw from for my targeted 350 DASH/month for output rewards.  My reserve would decrease from the current 3.8 month buffer to just around 2.4 months.  See the [Reserve Planning tab of our Incuabtor Accounting Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhXlo4ylqWLLSYN4MGiLWlp7Gq3jrsDt0kB701dwMNU/edit#gid=118961896) for details.  I'd like to have at least a 3-month buffer next quarter.
