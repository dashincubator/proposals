### Proposal - 2023 Q3 - Rion Gull

Internal budget proposal for Dash Incubator

### Background

The [Incubator rules doc (v3)](https://github.com/dashincubator/dash-incubator-rules/blob/042fde0eea2340a2a8c9fa3483ad8f764d94fe31/rules.md) directs the lead strategist to submit internal budget proposals to the strategic committee.

Section 5.1.2 (Strategist Proposals):

> Each Strategist submits quarterly proposals to the Lead Strategist to increase their budgets. The content and purpose of this proposal is similar to the Lead Strategistâ€™s Network Proposal. It should report project updates, value propositions, budget spending, quarterly priorities, and anything else the strategist wants to commmunicate in order to help justify the value delivered to the network for the funding received and requested.

Section 4.5 (Governance):

> The Strategic Committee is responsible to:
> 
> * Approve or reject Incubator rule changes (updates to this document).
> * Approve or reject quarterly budget requests from the Lead Strategist.

This proposal is for Q3 of 2023.

### Budget Request

This proposal is expected to be the last internal proposal in the Incubator.

I recently wrote a proposal to update the Incubator rules from v3 to v4, which does away with internal incubator proposals, having all strategists propose budgets directly from the Dash superblock / treasury.  That rule change has been approved by the strategic committee, but the pull request has not yet been merged, and therefore is not yet active.

I am requesting to transfer the remaining amount in the Incubator [General Reserve](https://insight.dash.org/insight/address/XpVFECgympGyGwRLet2xy14BBhFCWLiXhW) to my [Lead strategist reserve](https://insight.dash.org/insight/address/XwxXr39ErU7CK5fPe6N3AnDTi1kK9iDSmm) in order to facilitate the upcoming change to the v4 rules.  There is currently 816.66044857 DASH in the General Reserve.  I am requesting the entire amount excluding the minimum network fee required to send the transaction.  The remaining balance will be zero in the General Reserve, and it is no longer expected to be used.  This will result in my strategist reserve increasing from 164.99911785 DASH to just under 981.66 DASH.

Given my estimated 2023 Q3 network proposal request and my projected Q3 output, this should result in buffer of roughly 1.2 months for my reserve, which isn't much.  See the [Reserve Planning tab of our Incuabtor Accounting Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhXlo4ylqWLLSYN4MGiLWlp7Gq3jrsDt0kB701dwMNU/edit#gid=118961896) for details.  I'd like to build this to at least a 3-month buffer over time.
