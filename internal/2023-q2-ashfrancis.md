### Proposal - 2023 Q2 - Ash Francis (ashfrancis)

Internal budget proposal for Dash Incubator

### Background 

The [Incubator rules doc (v3)](https://github.com/dashincubator/dash-incubator-rules/blob/master/rules.md) directs individual strategists to submit internal budget proposals to the Lead Strategist.

From the Rules document:

> 5.1.2 Strategist Proposals #
> Each Strategist submits quarterly proposals to the Lead Strategist to increase their budgets. The content and purpose of this proposal is similar to the Lead Strategistâ€™s Network Proposal. It should report project updates, value propositions, budget spending, quarterly priorities, and anything else the strategist wants to commmunicate in order to help justify the value delivered to the network for the funding received and requested.

### Project Updates & Budget Spending

In Q1 2023 I funded the following Bounties:

* [Maya Integration](https://trello.com/c/jk6RTHGZ/224-maya-integration) - The Dash integration into Maya Protocol, a DEX and fork of THORChain: Integration complete, Dash due to be added imminently. 
* [Reference Dash Platform Extension](https://trello.com/c/h3xNUfHE/) - Proof of concept for a 'Metamask for Dash': Development progressing well.  
* [Summoners Dash Platform Game](https://trello.com/c/mRKNrEzb/) - A turn based strategy game with Dash bets & use of L1 and Platform: MVP complete, work forecast to resume Q4. 
* [DashPay Core Extension Wallet](https://trello.com/c/ndQObQDV/) - A L1 extension wallet: Completed (though may extend functionality further). 
* [Rust Dash RPC Client](https://trello.com/c/xp5NWpdO/) - Rust RPC client for L1: Completed. 

My requested budget for the period was 900 Dash, of which 570 Dash was distributed in rewards. 

### Quarterly Priorities & Value Propositions

During the upcoming quarter I intend to work on the following projects and tasks:
* [Maya Integration](https://trello.com/c/jk6RTHGZ/224-maya-integration) - Support through launch, infrastructure for genesis node and any related maintenance/updates.
* [Reference Dash Platform Extension](https://trello.com/c/h3xNUfHE/) - Continue to develop this towards testnet implementation with a dapp library and related features.
* [DashPay Wallet](https://trello.com/c/dCjtC7JH) - This will be a large focus on this quarter, getting this project to an MVP state (albeit dependent on reliable Dash Platform testnet & the reference extension)
* [Password Manager](https://trello.com/c/S48CSFL4/111-password-manager) - A decentralized password manager with encrypted storage on platform.
* [Influencer Affiliate Site](https://trello.com/c/JZFZNNRr/) - A data site for influencers to earn money (and payouts in Dash).
* [Governance Portal](https://trello.com/c/c36t7QSM/) - Work is now recommencing on this project.

### Budget Request

I am requesting 300 DASH/month for 3 months. This should cover the existing and new work as above based on cost forecasts. Any remaining funds will be applied to a buffer to ensure development continuity.
